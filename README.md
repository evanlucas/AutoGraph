AutoGraph
=========

This project is a port of my original [AutoGraph](https://github.com/jbeuckm/AutoGraph--old-version- "Original AutoGraph Project") to AngularJS.

The original was getting usable but needed a redesign to support the next steps in the roadmap: serialization, complexes, etc.

I am expecting a variety of benefits from the port:
1.
1. Cleaner testing with Protractor
2. Automated data binding (originally manual)
3.

###ROADMAP###

+ establish NPM project
+ verify SVG directives will work as they do in my wildest dreams
+ protractor running on TravisCI
+ headless Component & Wires implementation
+ templated Component directive interface
+ D3 Wires interface
+ OOP Controllers
+ ComponentLibrary
+ All v1 Components *represents parity with the original version*
+ serialization to LocalStorage
+ deserialization
+ Time Series Graph Component
+ OAuth.io Interface
